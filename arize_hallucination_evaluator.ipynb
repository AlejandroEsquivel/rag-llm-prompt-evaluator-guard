        "In this demo, we are going to set up and use a Guard that blocks the LLM from responding from attempted jailbreaks. We will do this using the `ArizeDatasetEmbeddings` Guard from Arize AI. This Guard works in the following way:\n",
        "*   The Guard computes embeddings for chunks associated with a set of few shot examples of \"bad\" user prompts or LLM messages (we recommend using 10 different prompts)\n",
        "*   When the the Guard is applied to a user or LLM message, the Guard computes the embedding for the input message and checks if any of the few shot \"train\" examples in the dataset are close to the message in embedded space\n",
        "*   If the cosine distance between the input message and any of the chunks is within the user-specified threshold (default setting is 0.2), then the Guard intercepts the LLM call.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this demo, we use the `ArizeDatasetEmbeddings` Guard in two ways, first on a dataset of jailbreak prompts, then subsequently on a dataset of PII prompts. In both cases, we apply the Guard to user input messages, rather than LLM output messages (although we could take either approach). If the Guard flags a jailbreak attempt or PII in the user message, we simply throw an `Exception`. Alternatively, in practice the user can specify a default LLM response that can be used when the Guard is triggered.\n"

Horrified at the prospect of having my inbox flooded by business plans (if I'd only known), I blurted out \"But not me!\" and went on with the talk.

I still get the glassy eye from strangers when they ask what I'm writing, and I explain that it's an essay I'm going to publish on my web site.
